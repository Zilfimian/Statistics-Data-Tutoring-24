- Q3. The variable 'budget_adjusted' represents the budget of the movies. Plot a scatter plot and calculate the correlation coefficient between the variables 'duration' and 'gross'. Repeat the analysis using the variables 'budget' and 'gross'.
The relationship between 'budget_adjusted' and 'gross' is (weak/strong/no relationship), and the correlation coefficient between 'budget' and 'gross' is ___.
- Q4. The variable 'cast_facebook_likes' represents the number of likes on Facebook for the cast of the movies. It is discrete and categorized as follows:
  - 1: Less than 1000 likes.
  - 2: Between 1000 and 5000 likes.
  - 3: Between 5000 and 10000 likes.
  - 4: More than 10000 likes.

The largest duration of movies that won one Oscar is ___, and the largest gross income of movies that didn't win an Oscar is ___.
- Q7. The variable ‘oldness’ represents the age of the movies. Create a new column, called 'age_group', and assign values as follows:
  - Assign the letter ‘A’ to movies with oldness less than 10.
  - Assign the letter 'B' to movies with oldness between 10 and 20.
  - Assign the letter 'C' to movies with oldness more than 20.
Calculate the average of the variable 'gross' for each of the previous categories.
The average of the variable 'gross' for the group A is ________, the average of the variable 'gross' for the group B is _________, and the average of the variable 'gross' for the group C is _________ (for all values type a single number rounding up to 4 decimal places).
- Q8 The variable 'duration' represents the duration of the movies. How many unique durations are there in the dataset? What is the maximum duration?
There are ____ unique durations in the dataset. The maximum duration is ______ (in both cases type a single number).
- Q9 Plot a histogram of the variable 'duration' using 15 bins. Describe the distribution.
The distribution is (right-skewed/pretty symmetric/left-skewed) _______ and (unimodal/bimodal/multimodal) _________.
- Q10 Sort the data using the variable ‘imdbRating’. What is the index value for the highest rated movie?
The index of the highest rated movie is ______ (type a single number).
- Q11 Calculate the percentage of movies with an 'imdbRating' above 7.5. Repeat the analysis for movies with an 'imdbRating' below 5.0.
The percentage of movies with an 'imdbRating' above 7.5 is ________, and the percentage of movies with an 'imdbRating' below 5.0 is ________(for both values type a single number rounding up to 4 decimal places).
- Q12
  -- a) What is the probability that the adjusted gross of a randomly selected movie lies between $66,000,000 and $74,000,000? (type a single number, round up to four decimal places)
  -- b) What is the probability that the Metascore of a randomly selected movie is greater than 75? (type a single number, round up to four decimal places)

  -- c) What is the probability that the duration of a randomly selected movie lies within 150 standard deviations of the mean? (type a single number, round up to four decimal places)

  -- d) What is the probability that the IMDb rating of a randomly selected movie is exactly 5.2? (type a single number, round up to four decimal places)

  -- e) What is the adjusted gross corresponding to the bottom 7%? The top 4%? (round up to four decimal places in both cases)

  -- f) What is the z-score of a movie whose IMDb rating is 7.4?
- Q13

  -- a) What is the probability that the next movie will have a duration of exactly 83 minutes? (type a single number. Round up to four decimal places)

  -- b) What is the probability that the next movie will have a Metascore within the next 102 minutes? (type a single number. Round up to four decimal places)

  -- c) What is the probability that the next movie will have an IMDb rating between 4.7 and 5.2 minutes? (type a single number. Round up to four decimal places)

  -- d) What is the probability that the next movie will have an IMDb rating of MORE THAN 7.7? (type a single number. Round up to four decimal places)

  -- e) What is the probability that the next movie will have a budget adjusted to be at least $40,000,000 if the average budget of movies is $60,000,000? (type a single number, round up to four decimal places)

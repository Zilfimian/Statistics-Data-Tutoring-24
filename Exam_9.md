# Questions 1

1. How many students are in the data?
2. Proportion of female students from the MS school whose mothers have attended primary school?
3. Proportion of individuals from Mousinho da Silveira whose father's education level is primary?
4. What is the gender of the student with the highest value of age?
5. Create a plot to visualize the relation between weekly study time and  final grade. Provide a numerical measure of such a relationship
6. Find the highest and the lowest value of age per school. Show the results of Mousinho da Silveira respectfully.

# Question 2

1. Test if the proportion of female students from Mousinho da Silveira is below 50%? Then, indicate whether it is or is not, using a significance level of 0.05. 
2. Test whether there exists enough evidence to claim that the average age of students for female students is equal to 16.5 years. Write t-stat.
3. Test whether the average final grades of students from Gabriel Pereira different between those from Mousinho da Silveira.
4. Conduct the appropriate ANOVA to reject or accept that the final grade depends on the education level of students' mothers.
5. Construct a confidence interval for the average age for woman from Gabriel Pereira school.
6. Define a dataset only for men. Calculate a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of men older than 16. Repeat the exercise for women. Compare.
7. Compute the IQR and the standard deviation of the variable age
8. Calculate the probability that a student in this datases from school Mousinho da Silveira. Once you have calculated this probability, what is the probability that, if we randomly select 10 students, at least 3 of them will is from Mousinho da Silveira? Round up to 3 decÂ¡mal places.

# Questions 3
1.  A call center receives an average of 10 calls per hour. Calculate the probability that the call center will receive exactly 15 calls in the next hour.
2. A website receives requests from users at a rate of 50 per hour. What is the probability that the time between consecutive requests is less than two minutes?
3. Consider average time between customer arrivals is three minutes. We want to find the probability that a new customer arrives in less than one minute after the previous customer.
4. Suppose a shop experiences customer arrivals, and the average time between customers entering the shop is two minutes. We want to find the probability that a new customer arrives in less than one minute after the previous customer.

1. Body temperatures of healthy humans are distributed nearly normally with a mean of 100.2°F and a standard deviation of 0.6°F. What is the cutoff for the lowest 3% of human body temperatures?
2. A bakery sells an average of 75 croissants in an hour. What's the probability that, during the morning hours (6 am to 12 pm), they'll sell more than 450 croissants in total?
3. A bus station serves passengers at a rate of 10 per hour. What is the probability that the time between consecutive passengers entering the station is less than ten minutes?
4. In a factory, the probability that a manufactured item is defective is 0.05. If 100 items are inspected, what is the probability that exactly 7 items will be defective?
5. At a juice factory, the amounts which go into bottles are supposed to be normally distributed with a mean of 16 oz. and a standard deviation of 0.05 oz. Once every 15 minutes, a bottle is selected from the production line, and its contents are measured precisely. If the amount of juice in the bottle is below 15.9 oz. or above 16.1 oz., then the bottle fails the quality control inspection. What percent of bottles fail the quality control inspection?
6. A new drug has a 75% chance of curing a patient. If the drug is given to 30 patients, what is the probability that at least 25 of them will be cured?
7. A bakery sells freshly baked bread, with customers arriving at the rate of 20 per hour. What is the probability that the time between consecutive customers is less than five minutes?
8. In a large orchard, the probability that an apple tree produces high-quality apples is 0.8. If an inspector randomly inspects 40 trees, what is the probability that between 30 and 35 trees (inclusive) produce high-quality apples?
9. An elevator in a building has a floor indicator that moves continuously from 1 to 10. Suppose you enter the building and the elevator is already in motion. You want to determine the probability that the elevator is currently between floors 3 and 7. Calculate this probability.
10. In a rural region of a developing country, electricity power failures occur following a Poisson distribution with an average of 2 failures every week. Calculate the probability that in a given week the electricity fails not more that 3 times.
11. In a survey, 70% of people prefer a new product over the existing one. If a sample of 50 people is surveyed, what is the probability that at least 40 people will prefer the new product?
12. A machine is programmed to randomly stop at a point along a 100-meter track to make a measurement. The stop point is uniformly distributed along the track. If you are interested in the probability that the machine stops between the 20-meter and 50-meter marks, how would you calculate this probability?
13. In a survey, it is found that 60% of people prefer tea over coffee. Suppose we randomly select five individuals. What is the probability that exactly 3 of them prefer tea?
14. A bookstore sells an average of 3 rare books per day. Calculate the probability that exactly 5 rare books will be sold in a single day.
15. At a milk factory, the amounts which go into cartons are supposed to be normally distributed with a mean of 64 oz. and a standard deviation of 0.2 oz. Every hour, a carton is selected from the production line, and its contents are measured precisely. If the amount of milk in the carton is below 63.7 oz. or above 64.3 oz., then the carton fails the quality control inspection. What percent of cartons fail the quality control inspection?
16. A factory produces electronic gadgets with a success rate of 85% (i.e., 85% of the gadgets are not defective). If a quality control test examines 40 gadgets, what is the probability that at least 35 gadgets are not defective?
17. A website experiences an average of 7 attacks per month. Calculate the probability that the website will experience no attacks in the next month.

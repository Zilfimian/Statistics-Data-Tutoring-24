How does the distribution of average number of rooms per dwelling vary across different categorized by 0-4 rooms, 4-5 rooms, 6-8 rooms, and 8+ rooms?
Our objective is to assess if there's a statistically significant difference in the median value of owner-occupied homes among these groups.

## Question 1

Utilizing boxplots, can we conclude that there's no substantial difference in the average median value of owner-occupied homes among the four groups? Hence, do the three groups start from the same point?"

## Question 2

Conduct an appropriate analysis, such as hypothesis testing, to address the aforementioned question.

## Question 3

What is the F statistic derived from the analysis?

## Question 4

Could you specify the degrees of freedom (df1 and df2) associated with our analysis?

## Question 5

What is the critical value corresponding to a significance level of 95%?

## Question 6 - 8

Can we determine if there are similarities in median prices between 
- the 0-4 rooms and 4-5 rooms,
- 6-8 rooms groups compared to the 8+ rooms group
- the 0-4 rooms and 6-8 rooms groups

## Question 7

Provide the 99% confidence interval for the mean of median home values in the Boston housing dataset

## Question 8

What is the standard error of the mean of median home values in the Boston housing dataset?

## Question 9

What is the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of rooms with more than 4 rooms in the Boston housing dataset?

## Question 10

Is there a significant difference in the median housing prices between areas along the Charles River (indicated by a dummy variable of 1) and those not along the river? 
 (alpha = 0.05)
 
## Question 11

Are the proportions of housing units along the Charles River and those not along the river the same? (alpha = 0.05)

## Question 12

## Question 13

## Question 14

## Question 15

## Question 16

**Customer Satisfaction Survey Analysis**

A retail company wants to gauge the satisfaction level of its customers regarding a new product. They conducted a survey among a sample of 600 customers, of which 420 expressed satisfaction with the product. Calculate the 99% confidence interval for the proportion of satisfied customers in the entire customer base.

## Question 17

**Service Quality Evaluation**

A service provider wishes to assess the quality of service provided to its clients. They randomly selected 200 clients from their database and found that 160 of them rated the service as excellent. Compute the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of clients who perceive the service as excellent across the entire client base.

## Question 18

A manufacturing plant is interested in estimating the mean diameter of a certain component produced on their assembly line. They take a random sample of 80 components and measure their diameters (in millimeters). The population standard deviation of the diameters for all components produced by this plant is known to be 2.5 mm. Mean = 15. Calculate the 99% confidence interval for the mean diameter of the components.

How does the distribution of average number of rooms per dwelling vary across different categorized by 0-4 rooms, 4-5 rooms, 6-8 rooms, and 8+ rooms?
Our objective is to assess if there's a statistically significant difference in the median value of owner-occupied homes among these groups.

## Question 1

Utilizing boxplots, can we conclude that there's no substantial difference in the average median value of owner-occupied homes among the four groups? Hence, do the three groups start from the same point?"

## Question 2

Conduct an appropriate analysis, such as hypothesis testing, to address the aforementioned question.

## Question 3

What is the F statistic derived from the analysis?

## Question 4

Could you specify the degrees of freedom (df1 and df2) associated with our analysis?

## Question 5

What is the critical value corresponding to a significance level of 95%?

## Question 6 - 8

Can we determine if there are similarities in median prices between 
- the 0-4 rooms and 4-5 rooms,
- 6-8 rooms groups compared to the 8+ rooms group
- the 0-4 rooms and 6-8 rooms groups

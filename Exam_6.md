# Questions 1

Use the [following dataset](https://github.com/shrikant-temburwar/Loan-Prediction-Dataset/blob/master/train.csv) to solve the task.

## Metadata: [see here](https://github.com/shrikant-temburwar/Loan-Prediction-Dataset/blob/master/README.md)

Q1: The number of individuals who are married and have applied for a loan is (write the number, do not use decimals).

Q2: Plot the proper chart to answer the following question: What is the distribution of logarithm of applicant incomes in this sample? (write: symmetric/right skewed/left skewed)

Q3: What is the correlation coefficient between applicant income and loan amount requested? (write the number, use three decimals)

Q4: Using all the data, construct a 95% confidence interval around the proportion of applicants with a good credit history. The lower limit is (write the number, use three decimals) ___ and the upper limit is (write the number, use three decimals).

Q5: What proportion of applicants with a graduate education have been approved for a loan?

Q6: Test if the proportion of married applicants among those with dependents is less than 50%. (write: it is/it is not) Use alpha = 0.05.

Q7: Test if the proportion of applicants with a good credit history among those who are self-employed is more than 60%. (write: it is/it is not) Use alpha = 0.01.

**Questions 2**


Q8: In Milgram’s experiment, each person can be considered as a trial. We label a person as a “success” if they refuse to administer a severe shock and as a “failure” if they do administer such a shock. Given that only 35% of people refused to administer a shock (probability of success, (p = 0.35)), we want to find the probability that exactly 1 out of four randomly selected individuals will refuse to administer the shock.

Q9: Suppose a shop experiences customer arrivals, and the average time between customers entering the shop is two minutes. We want to find the probability that a new customer arrives in less than one minute after the previous customer.

Q10: Suppose the body temperatures of healthy humans are distributed nearly normally with a mean of 98.2∘F
 and a standard deviation of 0.73∘F. We want to find the cutoff temperature for the lowest 3% of human body temperatures.

Q11: Suppose we have ACT scores from a group of high school students. The scores follow a nearly normal distribution with a mean of 24
 and a standard deviation of 4. We want to find the cutoff ACT score for the lowest 10%

Q12: Consider average time between customer arrivals is three minutes. We want to find the probability that a new customer arrives in less than one minute after the previous customer. 

**Question 3**
Create the DataFrame ‘df’:
Group: A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C
Score: 10, 12, 15, 8, 11, 13, 6, 9, 12

Q13. Calculate the F-test statistic:

Q14. It follows an F-distribution.

Q15. We calculate p-values associated with the F-test statistic.

Q16. We reject the null hypothesis or do not reject.

Accept/Reject:
Q17. If there is a statistically significant difference between Group A and Group B.

Q18. Whether Group A and Group C have identical means.

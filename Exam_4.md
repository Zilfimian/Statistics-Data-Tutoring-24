# Question 1

We’ll assume the mean duration is 120 minutes. SD = 15. Suppose duration is normally distributed variable.


1.1 Probability that a randomly selected movie duration is between 115 and 125 minutes

1.2 Probability that a randomly selected movie duration is greater than 130 minutes

1.3 Probability that a movie duration lies within 0.75 standard deviations of the mean

1.4 Probability that a movie duration is exactly 110 minutes

1.5 Durations corresponding to the bottom 10% and 5%

1.6 Z-score for a movie with a duration of 140 minutes


**Suppose we’re dealing with the number of emails received per hour, and the average number of emails is 8.**

1.7 Probability that the next email will arrive exactly 2 minutes from now:

1.8 Probability that the next email will arrive without waiting for the next 5 minutes:

1.9 Probability that no emails arrive for at least 3 minutes

1.10 Probability that emails arrive between 1 and 4 minutes from now

1.11 Probability that no emails arrive for at least 3 minutes (when the average number of emails received is 12 per hour):

# Question 2
Create a variable categorizing Oscars won into groups: 0, 1-3, 4-5, higher.

**2.1** Generate boxplots to visualize gross earnings differences across categories. Are there differences?

**2.2** If yes, is the trend negative or positive?

Conduct ANOVA to assess disparities in gross earnings categories.

**2.3** What is the F-test statistic?

**2.4** What are the p-values?

**2.5** Do we reject or accept the null hypothesis?

Perform post hoc tests to identify specific differences between Oscar won categories. Which group differs from which? Utilize Bonferroni adjustment.

**2.6** Are the "no won" and "high" groups the same or different?

**2.7** Are the "no won" and "group 1" the same or different?

**2.8** The p-value for the "1-3" and "4-5" groups is ____. 

**2.9** Do we reject or accept the hypothesis?

# Question 3

Create a DataFrame named 'df' with the following data:

Group: A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C
Score: 10, 12, 15, 8, 11, 13, 6, 9, 12

Perform ANOVA to evaluate if there are differences in scores between groups.

**1.** What is the F-test statistic?
   
**2.** What are the p-values?
   
**3.** Do we reject or accept the null hypothesis?

If significant differences are found in ANOVA, conduct post hoc tests:

Accept/Reject

**4.** There is a statistically significant difference between Group A and Group B.

**5.** Group A and Group C have identical means.

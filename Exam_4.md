# Question 1
Use movies data for this task.

**a)** What is the probability that the next movie will have a duration of exactly 83 minutes? (type a single number. Round up to four decimal places)

**b)** What is the probability that the next movie will have a Metascore within the next 102 minutes? (type a single number. Round up to four decimal places)

**c)** What is the probability that the next movie will have an IMDb rating between 4.7 and 5.2 minutes? (type a single number. Round up to four decimal places)

**d)** What is the probability that the next movie will have an IMDb rating of MORE THAN 7.7? (type a single number. Round up to four decimal places)

**e)** What is the probability that the next movie will have a budget adjusted to be at least $40,000,000 if the average budget of movies is $60,000,000? (type a single number, round up to four decimal places)

**f)** What is the probability that the next movie will not have an Oscar nomination for at least 2 years? (type a single number, round up to four decimal places)

# Question 2
Create a variable categorizing Oscars won into groups: 0, 1-3, 4-5, higher.

**2.1** Generate boxplots to visualize gross earnings differences across categories. Are there differences?

**2.2** If yes, is the trend negative or positive?

Conduct ANOVA to assess disparities in gross earnings categories.

**2.3** What is the F-test statistic?

**2.4** What are the p-values?

**2.5** Do we reject or accept the null hypothesis?

Perform post hoc tests to identify specific differences between Oscar won categories. Which group differs from which? Utilize Bonferroni adjustment.

**2.6** Are the "no won" and "high" groups the same or different?

**2.7** Are the "no won" and "group 1" the same or different?

**2.8** The p-value for the "1-3" and "4-5" groups is ____. 

**2.9** Do we reject or accept the hypothesis?

# Question 3

Create a DataFrame named 'df' with the following data:

Group: A, A, A, B, B, B, C, C, C
Score: 10, 12, 15, 8, 11, 13, 6, 9, 12

Perform ANOVA to evaluate if there are differences in scores between groups.

**1.** What is the F-test statistic?
   
**2.** What are the p-values?
   
**3.** Do we reject or accept the null hypothesis?

If significant differences are found in ANOVA, conduct post hoc tests:

Accept/Reject

**4.** There is a statistically significant difference between Group A and Group B.

**5.** Group A and Group C have identical means.

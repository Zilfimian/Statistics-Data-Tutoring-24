# Exam 1
Use `biodata.csv` uploaded on course Github to analyze the relationship between the presence of kidney disease and different factors of patients. 
The description of the variables is given with a separate file.

## Questions 1
Using data on chronic kidney disease patients, test whether if the hemoglobin levels of individuals with chronic kidney disease exceed 10.5. Consider an alpha level of 0.05 and answer the following questions:
- Q1: How many patients in the dataset have chronic kidney disease? (Write the number, do not use decimals)
- Q2: What is the standard deviation of blood glucose random levels among the patients with chronic kidney disease? (Write the number, use two decimals) 
- Q3: What is the average age of patients with chronic kidney disease? (Write the number, use two decimals)
- Q4: What is the standard error used to conduct this test? (Write the number, use two decimals)
- Q5: What is the average hemoglobin levels of individuals with chronic kidney disease?
- Q6: What is the test statistic of this association test? (Write the number, use two decimals)
- Q7: What is the p-value of this association test?
- Q8: What is the critical value for this test at the 0.05 significance level?
- Q9: What is the conclusion of this test? (Write: reject H0/fail to reject H0)

## Questions 2
- Q1: The number of individuals with chronic kidney disease with normal red blood cells is (write the number, do not use decimals)
- Q2: Using all the data, the lowest value of the hemoglobin levels is (write the number, use two decimals) 
- Q3: Plot the proper chart to answer the following question: the distribution of hemoglobin levels of individuals in this sample is (write: symmetric/right skewed/left skewed) 
- Q4: The correlation coefficient between age and blood glucose random levels is (write the number, use three decimals)
- Q5: Using all the data, construct a 95% confidence interval around the proportion of individuals with hypertension. The lower limit is (write the number, use three decimals) ___ and the upper limit is (write the number, use three decimals) 
- Q6: The proportion of individuals with diabetes mellitus among those with chronic kidney disease is
- Q7: Test if the proportion of individuals with diabetes mellitus among those with chronic kidney disease is less than 40%. (write: it is/it is not) Use alpha = 0.05.
- Q8: Test if the proportion of individuals with diabetes mellitus among those with chronic kidney disease is more than 50%. (write: it is/it is not) Use alpha = 0.01.

## Questions 3
Using the whole sample, create a new variable that divides the individuals between those with high hemoglobin levels (individuals with hemoglobin levels above its average) and those with low hemoglobin levels (individuals with hemoglobin levels below or equal to its average). Then test if the average age is different in these two groups of individuals. Consider an alpha of 0.1 and respond to the following questions:
- Q1: The number of individuals in the group with high hemoglobin levels is (write the number, do not use decimals)
- Q2: The average age in the group with low hemoglobin levels is (write the number, use two decimals) 
- Q3: The standard deviation of age in the group with high hemoglobin levels is (write the number, use two decimals) 
- Q4: The test statistic of the test is (write the number, use two decimals)
- Q5: The p-value of the test is (write the number, use two decimals) 
- Q6: The lower bound of the confidence interval of the difference in means is ___(write the number, use two decimals), and its upper bound is ___(write the number, use two decimals)
